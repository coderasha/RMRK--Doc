Documentation Regarding RMRK

_ Its a protocol or its a set of rules and specifications for how to interpret special messages submitted to the blockchain.
Its dedicated to establishing a standard NFT cross-chain infrastructure on the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. RMRK introduces the ‘system remark’ function, allowing users to create their own NFTs.

**The mechanics of RMRK.app**
It is unfortunate to note that the Kusama chain cannot harbor NFTs. Unlike Ethereum, Kusama lacks smart contracts on the chain. The RMRK.app team found a way to tackle this challenge, and users can now attach information alongside a block. NFTs on RMRK.app are divided into collections. A perfect example of a collection is Kanaria, the first collection where hatching eggs reveal birds.
